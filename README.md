## Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects, code samples, and resources that I've created during my studies and hands-on work with the LPC55S69 microcontroller. These projects cover a wide range of topics related to embedded systems programming, such as:

- Blinking LED
- GPIO Interfacing
- UART Communication
- I2C and SPI Communication
- Interrupt Handling
- and more!

Feel free to explore the projects, learn from the code, and use them as a reference for your own embedded systems development with the LPC55S69.
